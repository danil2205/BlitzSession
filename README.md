BlitzSession is a website dedicated to the popular game World of Tanks Blitz, designed to provide players with a comprehensive tool to analyze their performance and enhance their gameplay experience.

## Motivation
World of Tanks Blitz boasts a massive fan base, and i want to make website that offers valuable insights and data analysis for players. As avid gamers ourselves, I understand the significance of statistics in shaping gameplay decisions, such as tank selection, performance improvement strategies, and issue identification. My motivation behind BlitzSession is to fill this gap and provide World of Tanks Blitz players with a user-friendly and feature-rich website to analyze their performance comprehensively
